### To start, run `yarn` to rebuild the dependencies and then run `yarn start` to start the development server!

### Installation steps I've already done to create this repository (assuming we start from a fresh machine):
1. Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
1. Install yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
1. Install create-react-app (CRA): https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
1. Add `node-sass` to this project: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/
1. Add `eslint` to this project: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
    - Also added `.eslintrc.json` to allow the linter in the IDE to reconize React & JSX syntax
1. Remove traces of serviceWorker: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54771291
    - Because we won't be covering PWA (Progress Web App) with this workshop
    - You can learn more about it here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/
